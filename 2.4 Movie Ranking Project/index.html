				Francis Ford Coppola's epic crime saga is a masterclass in filmmaking on every
				level. With its intricate exploration of an Italian-American crime family's
				generational dynamics, brilliant performances, iconic quotable dialogue, and
				influence that still resonates today, it transcended the genre to become a
				definitive American movie milestone.

				This gritty action thriller took the standard action hero archetype and subverted
				it. Starring a physically imposing but vulnerable Sylvester Stallone as Vietnam
				veteran John Rambo, it explores themes of PTSD, the mistreatment of veterans, and
				the excessive use of force by authorities. With intense action grounded in pathos,
				it elevated the genre.

			<h3>The Sound Of Music (1965)</h3>

			<p>
				This lush, visually stunning Rodgers & Hammerstein musical struck a chord with its
				simple but resonant story of family, freedom, and following your passion set against
				the looming shadow of the Nazi threat in Austria. With Julie Andrews' star-making
				performance and an infinitely hummable score, it overcame initial doubts to become a
				beloved classic.
